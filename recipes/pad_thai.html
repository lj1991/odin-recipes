    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Today we are going to cook a classic pad thai dish. This is a filling and savory dish that is a family favorite.
            I don't have one of those 10 page testimonials talking about how pad thai changed my life. This is a no-frills 
            food blog and I want <strong>you</strong> getting to work ASAP!

        <li>In a bowl, combine fish, tamarind paste, brown sugar, rice vinegar, and a generous squirty of sriracha. Stirl well.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a skill on medium to high heat. Add pressed tofu cubes and fry until crispy, about 12 minutes. Remove tofu and set aside on plate.</li>
        <li>Add 1-2 eggs to pan. fry for 2 minutes, breaking egg into small pieces. Remove from pan and set aside</li>
        <li>Drain noodles, then add to large mixing bowl with sauce. Mix well, then add to pan on low heat.</li>
        <li>Add back eggs and tofu to pan. You will want to continuously stir noodles so that they don't get sticky. Let it sizzle until noodles have pleasant texture.</li>
        <li>Plate your pad thai. Add green onion and peanuts.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
